# houseKeeperBot
Just a little Python tool which alows to send you and your partners emails with the work you have to do every week and so on...
Created for the use on windows with configurabel batch application

In the first step I have created several .txt files which are saving tzhe actual date
Then the code reviews the date and creates a new task email if it has expired
In the last step several emails are send to the members of the household
the batch file is to automate the task on windows where it can be added to autostart
